<h1 style=font-size:20pt> My biggest hobby is Music. </h1> 
<p>I played Flute for 8 years in school and was first chair in our highest audition band by the time I graduated. I also play piano guitar ukulele and piccolo. I have always loved music and it is the one thing that always makes me feel better. I enjoy learning it and I think music is a great way to express yourself. Music is also very good for the mind and is almost like learning a second language.
