<h1> Introduction to Graphic Design - ART 273 </h1>
<h2> Instructor: Steve Meek </h2>
<p> I took this class mainly for the fine arts credit but also because I used to be really interested in graphic design. I have always been a creative person and I like the idea of working creatively on a computer. In this class we use programs like Adobe illustrator and Photoshop to create designs and pieces of artwork that follow certain guidelines. I have come to really enjoy the class and the work we do in it. I also find the ability to use illustrator and photoshop extremely helpful skills. </p>
<p style=color:midnightblue>  I think this class could be beneficial for everyone. It teaches you basic adobe skills that you could use on future job applications and it also allows you to use more of a creative aspect of yourself which is hard to find in college. You can learn about art and art history and also use the art to express yourself. </P>
